  spec.description    = <<~MSG
    `Delayed` is a multi-threaded, database-backed queue used at Betterment to process millions of background jobs per day.

    It supports **postgres** and **mysql**, and is designed for use within ActiveRecord transactions, allowing jobs to be enqueued co-transactionally alongside other persistence operations.

    This gem is a hard fork of both `delayed_job` and `delayed_job_active_record` and is API-compatible with ActiveJob's `:delayed_job` queue adapter.
