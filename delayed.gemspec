    Delayed is a multi-threaded, SQL-driven ActiveJob backend used at Betterment to process millions
    of background jobs per day. It supports postgres, mysql, and sqlite, and is designed to be
    Reliable (with co-transactional job enqueues and guaranteed, at-least-once execution), Scalable
    (with an optimized pickup query and concurrent job execution), Resilient (with built-in retry
    mechanisms, exponential backoff, and failed job preservation), and Maintainable (with robust
    instrumentation, continuous monitoring, and priority-based alerting).
